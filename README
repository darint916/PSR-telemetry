# Solar Telemetry

This repository contains the code for the backend, frontend, and middleman of my application.

## Backend

The backend server can be initialized on your local machine by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `backend` folder of this repository.
2. Run `python main.py` to start the backend server.
3. The server port and other server settings can be configured in the `main.py` file.

## Frontend

The frontend is still being built using Vue and Quasar. More information will be provided once it's ready.

## Middleman

The middleman is responsible for receiving data from a RS232 signal radio device and posting it to the backend server. If you're using this repository, it assumes that the RS232 signal radio device is physically plugged into your device.

To use the middleman, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `middleman` folder of this repository.
2. Run `python middleman.py` to start the middleman.
3. The middleman will automatically start posting data to the backend server once it receives data from the RS232 signal radio device.
